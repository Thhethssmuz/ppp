# Numbered References

This extension extends the syntax for in-document links and allows auto generated numbers to be included in the link itself. The extension will replace the character # with the generated number for the referenced section heading, figure, table, etc..

**Example**:

```
### Some section

...

See [Section # Some section](#some-section), fore something important I mentioned there...
```
